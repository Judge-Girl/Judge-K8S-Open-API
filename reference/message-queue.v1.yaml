    This document describes the AMQP APIs we design for the RabbitMQ.

    Since Open API Spec is not for AMQP, we can only describe the AMQP elements in the HTTP-like way:

    1. HTTP path => AMQP Topic
    2. The URL 'a.{b}.c' => the topic route 'a.{b}.c' where b is a variable
    3. Response body => payload

    Topic Exchange:

    Every resource root of path is a **Topic Exchange**, for example:
    `submission.{submissiondId}.judge` is a path, then this indicates that
    there is a `submission` Topic exchange.
servers: []
paths:
  'submissions.{submissionId}.judge':
